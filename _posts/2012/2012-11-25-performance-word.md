## Response Time

Amount of time system takes to process a request after it has received one

处理一个请求的时间


## Latency

In simplest terms this is Remote Response time

远程响应时间


## Throughput

transactions per second your application can handle 

每秒事务数

## Scalability

is the measure of how your system responds when additional hardware is added

增加硬件资源系统的反应


## Stress testing 

if you find yourself running tests for more than 24 hours you are doing a stress test

24小时持续不间断测试，寻找系统从压力或者负载中恢复的条件


## Robustness

an attribute that is measured as part of stress testing relates to long running systems with almost negligible down time

鲁棒性，压力测试的结果属性
