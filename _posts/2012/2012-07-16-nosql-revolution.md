```
Revolutions are endemic to tech culture. 
A new group comes along and wonders why the last generation built something so complex, and they set out to tear down the old institutions. 
After a bit, they begin to realize why all of the old institutions were so complex, and they start implementing the features once again.
```

新组织来了，看到前任怎么做了这么复杂的系统，于是推倒重来，但是很快意识到自己又陷入到了相同的复杂性中，于是又开始轮回。
