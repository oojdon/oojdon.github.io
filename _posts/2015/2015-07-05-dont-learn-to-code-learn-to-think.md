title: 多思考 少code
---
在全民都在热衷于要写代码的时候，这篇文章给出另一个观点，我们应该多思考，而不是总想去编码

Computer science is the study of computation: that is, how to represent and process information. Here are just a few of the concepts you might study:

- Problem solving: you’ll learn algorithms - that is, general strategies, such as divide and conquer, recursion, heuristics, greedy search, and randomized algorithms - that help you model, decompose, and solve any kind of problem.

- Logic: you will start to use precise and formal methods of thinking, including abstraction, boolean logic, number theory, and set theory, so you can solve problems in an air tight manner.

- Data: you will touch information theory and start asking questions like what is information? How do you represent it? How do you model the real world?

- Systems: how do you design and build complex systems that satisfy a set of requirements and constraints? Systems engineering is an essential topic in almost every business.

- Thinking: one of the best ways to understand the human mind is to try to replicate it. Topics like artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing are at the forefront of not only computer science, but also biology, psychology, philosophy, and mathematics.


Note that the above list doesn’t really mention coding or programming, because they are just tools that can perform computation: they are not, in and of themselves, computer science.
Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes, biology about microscopes, or chemistry about beakers and test tubes. Science is not about tools.
