[原文](https://fire.ci/blog/the-difference-between-ci-and-cd/)



Continuous Integration is a team problem

持续集成是一个团队问题


```
Continuous Integration is all about preventing the main branch of being broken so your team is not stuck. That’s it. It is not about having all your tests green all the time and the main branch deployable to production at every commit.
```

```
持续集成就是为了防止主分支被破坏，从而使您的团队不会陷入困境。这并不是要让所有测试始终保持绿色并且主分支在每次提交时都可以部署到生产中。
```



Continuous Delivery and Deployment are engineering problems

持续交付和部署是工程问题


Craft your CI and CD builds to achieve these goals and keep your team productive. No workflow is perfect. Problems will happen every now and then. Use them as lessons learned to strengthen your workflow every time they do.

精心设计CI和CD版本以实现这些目标并保持团队的生产力。**没有工作流程是完美的**。问题会时不时地发生。每次使用它们时，都可以将其作为学习的经验教训来加强您的工作流程。
