BY ROBERT FROST

```
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.

```

```
黄色的树林里分出两条路，
可惜我不能同时去涉足，
我在那路口久久伫立，
我向着一条路极目望去，
直到它消失在丛林深处。
但我却选了另外一条路，
它荒草萋萋，十分幽寂；
显得更诱人、更美丽，
虽然在这两条小路上，
都很少留下旅人的足迹。
虽然那天清晨落叶满地，
两条路都未见脚印痕迹。
呵，留下一条路等改日再见！
但我知道路径延绵无尽头，
恐怕我难以再回返。
也许多少年后在某个地方，
我将轻声叹息把往事回顾：
一片树林里分出两条路，
而我选了人迹更少的一条，
从此决定了我一生的道路。
