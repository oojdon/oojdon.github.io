title: Jira是反模式

One thing that writing elegant software has in common with art: its crafters should remain cognizant of the overall macro vision of the project at the same time they are working on its smallest micro details. JIRA, alas, implicitly teaches everyone to ignore the larger vision while focusing on details.

编写优雅的软件与艺术有一个共同之处:它的设计者应该在处理项目的最小的微观细节的同时，保持对项目整体宏观远景的认识。可惜的是，JIRA含蓄地教导每个人忽略更大的愿景，而专注于细节。
