Grady Booch’s Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications, 2nd Edition
 
这是一本非常好的书，文中作者推荐阅读第二版
 
 
The best part of OOADA is the introduction, drawing ideas from psychology and sociology to explain what classes and objects meant.
 
最好的部分是引言，从社会学和心理学角度解释类和对象
 
 
作者还推荐了一本 Bertrand Meyer’s Object-Oriented Software Construction, 2nd Edition (OOSC)
 
 
Bertrand Meyer is, hands down, the best writer in the computer field, because of a simple reason: his books have both great content and great prose. Not all authors of computer books (and certainly not the one you are reading now) can make the same claim.
 
Meyer的书是少有的内容好又是好散文的书。
