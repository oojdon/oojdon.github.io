编程是直觉
编程艺术性是一个问题
编程的快乐
```



The conclusion of this article is that… well, there is no conclusion. Art or Not Art, it does not matter; programming is something we do. In the humble opinion of this author, the joy of programming is what makes it an art; we become artists the moment we find happinness while making things happen in a computer.

其实并没有得到结论

编程的乐趣使它成为一门艺术;当我们在电脑里做事情的时候发现了快乐，我们就成了艺术家。


And so it happens that this joy is personal, and most often than not, very hard to share with others. We all feel sometimes like a Mark Watney celebrating in Mars, all alone, that something worked. We know that feeling.

因此，这种快乐是个人的，而且通常很难与他人分享
