1

Maxwell's four equations describing how an electromagnetic field varies in space and time.

2

Euler's equation of momentum-flow and force-density in fluid dynamics.

3

Newton's Second Law (F=ma) - 'The rate of change of momentum of a body is equal to the resultant force acting on the body and is in the same direction'.

4

Pythagoras's Theorum (a²+b²=c²) - In any right triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse (the side of a right triangle opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares on the other two sides.

5

Schrödinger's equation describing the time-dependence of quantum mechanical systems.

6

Boltzmann equation describing the statistical distribution of particles in a fluid.

7

Principle of Least Action (or Principle of stationary action)

8

De Broglie's equation - showing that the wavelength is inversely proportional to the momentum of a particle and that the frequency is directly proportional to the particle's kinetic energy

9

Fourier Transformation - an integral transform that re-expresses a function in terms of sinusoidal basis functions.

10

Einstein's field equations for General Relativity
