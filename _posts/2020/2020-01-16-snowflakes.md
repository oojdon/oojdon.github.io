For 75 years, physicists have known that the tiny crystals in snow fit into two prevailing types. 

One is the iconic flat star, with either six or 12 points, each decorated with matching branches of lace in a dizzying array of possibility. 

The other is a column, sometimes sandwiched by flat caps and sometimes resembling a bolt from a hardware store. These different shapes occur at different temperatures and humidities, 

but the reason for this has been a mystery.

75年以来，物理学家已经知道雪中的微小晶体可以分为两种主要类型。

一个是标志性的扁平星，它有6或12个点，每个点都装饰有相匹配的花边分支，令人眼花缭乱。

另一个是圆柱，有时被平顶帽夹在中间，有时类似于五金店的螺栓。这些不同的形状在不同的温度和湿度下发生，

**但是其原因一直是个谜。**
