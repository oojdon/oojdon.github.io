思考：

```
对比软件开发和医生，律师，飞行员，建筑师的成长过程
```



All the evidence shows that programming requires a high level of aptitude that only a small percentage of the population possess

所有的证据都表明，编程需要很高的才能，而只有一小部分人具备这种能力


The current fad for short learn-to-code courses is selling people a lie and will do nothing to help the skills shortage for professional programmers.

短期学习编码课程的当下风尚正在向人们撒谎，并且无助于解决专业程序员的技能短缺问题


Even programmers with CS degrees insist that they are largely self taught

即使是具有CS学位的程序员也坚持认为，他们在很大程度上是自学的


the rate of change in the industry means that you never stop learning.

行业的变化速度意味着您永远都不会停止学习


So even if you did at some point have formal training, you can’t rely on that for a successful career. Any formal course will be just a small element of the continual learning that defines the career of a programmer.

即使您曾经接受过正式培训，也无法依靠它来获得成功的职业生涯。任何正式课程都将只是定义程序员职业的持续学习中的一小部分


There’s another problem with software development that’s the flip side of the low barriers to entry mentioned above

软件开发还有另一个问题，就是上述入门门槛低的另一面，而且没有进入行业的完善入门途径


In the meantime we should stop selling people a lie. Programming is not easy, it is hard. You can’t learn to code, certainly not to a standard to get a well-paid-job-of-the-future, in just a few weeks.
The majority of the population can not learn to code at all, no matter how much training they receive

同时，我们应该停止向人们撒谎。编程并不容易，很难。您不可能在短短几周内就学会编码，当然也没有达到获得高薪职位的标准。无论他们接受了多少培训，大多数人根本无法学习编码
