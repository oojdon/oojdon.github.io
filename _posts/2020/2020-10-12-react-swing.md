```
It’s not like Angular or Polymer
based on Dart, a modern beautiful programming language
React does not: a built-in UI widget library.
Flutter is not like Cordova or PhoneGap
Flutter is not like React Native
It reinvents its own UI component library from scratch
This is basically the exact same approach as JavaSwing.
There are no external UI DSLs (i.e. html or xml files)
I have an odd-ball opinion that external DSL’s are the root of all evil
With Flutter, UI’s are coded in the same language as the rest of the app
Finally, they have first class support for my favorite IDE (JetBrains)
