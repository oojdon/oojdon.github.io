根据[这篇文章](http://liupzmin.com/2019/11/06/docker/container-chat/)


按照时间线梳理下，Linux 在其内核 2.4.19 版本上加入了 Namesapce 功能,内核4.6中又添加了Cgroup namespace,2008 年，通过将 Cgroups 的资源管理能力和 Linux Namespace 的视图隔离能力组合在一起， LXC（Linux Container） 这样的完整的容器技术出现在了 Linux 内核当中

2013年，Docker 的第一个版本发布

2014年，Docker 0.9 发布，用 libcontainer 库代替了原来的 LXC 

Kubernetes 源于 Google 内部的 Borg 项目，经 Google 使用 Go 语言重写后，被命名为 Kubernetes，并于 2014 年 6 月开源
