Good software is approachable. It can be understood completely in independent, easy pieces. You don’t need to understand everything before you can understand anything.

Good software is consistent. It lets you take what you’ve learned about one part and extrapolate it to the rest. It doesn’t self-contradict. It is parsimonious, avoiding superfluous elements.

Good software explains itself. It has affordances for learning and discovery. It is role-expressive and minimizes hidden magic.

Good software teaches. It doesn’t just automate an existing task, but provides insight or imparts knowledge, such as a best practice or a new perspective on a problem.

Good software is for humans. It is cognizant of people and the reality in which they live. It does not expect elaborate and arbitrary rules to be memorized. It anticipates the need for learning and debugging.


优秀的软件富有亲和力，在你理解某个地方之前，不必理解每个地方。

优秀的软件符合一致性。你在某处掌握的东西，可以推演到其它地方。不自我矛盾，简化，没有多余元素。

优秀的软件能够解释自己。

优秀的软件能够教东西。它除了自动化已有任务，还提供了见解、或传达着知识，比如某种最佳实践、或某个问题的新视角。

优秀的软件以人文本。
