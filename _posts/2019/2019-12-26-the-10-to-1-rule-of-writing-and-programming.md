[原文](https://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2018/08/12/the-10-to-1-rule-of-writing-and-programming/)


```
Hofstadter’s Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter’s Law.
```

```
侯世达定律：做事所花费的时间总是比你预期的要长，即使你的预期中考虑了侯世达定律。
```

```

The ratio of “raw materials” to “finished product” in a book is roughly 10:1. Keep this in mind the next time an editor asks you for a timeline! If you want to write a 300 page book, you’ll probably have to write around 3,000 pages.

Similarly, the ratio of “code churn” to “lines of code” in mature and non-trivial software is also at least 10:1. Keep this in mind the next time a manager or customer asks you for a time estimate! To build a 10,000 line app, expect to write roughly 100,000 lines.

一本300页的书需要写3000页，然后不断修改和删除
一万行代码的app，必须写十万行代码然后修改和删除

```
Mysql: 16:1
Jquery: 15:1
Express.js: 14:1
Terraform: 9:1
