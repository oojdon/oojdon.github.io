[Qc Na](http://people.csail.mit.edu/gregs/ll1-discuss-archive-html/msg03277.html)

Anton van Straaten:

```
On his next walk with Qc Na, 
Anton attempted to impress his master by saying “Master, I have diligently studied the matter, 
and now understand that objects are truly a poor man’s closures.” 
Qc Na responded by hitting Anton with his stick, saying “When will you learn? Closures are a poor man’s object.” 
At that moment, Anton became enlightened.
```
