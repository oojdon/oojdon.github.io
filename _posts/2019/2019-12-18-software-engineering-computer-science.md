title:  软件工程不等于计算机科学

[原文](https://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/software-engineering-computer-science/217701907)



I studied algorithms and complexity. The field is wonderfully clean, with each concept clearly defined, and each result building on earlier proofs.

算法和复杂度领域干净，明确定义

Now I work on software engineering, and this area is maddeningly slippery. No concept is precisely defined.

软件领域模糊


```
Software engineering will never be a rigorous discipline with proven results, because it involves human activity
```
软件工程永远不是一个严谨的学科，因为它涉及人类的活动


Good software engineering also includes creativity, vision, multi-disciplinary thinking, and humanity.

好的软件工程还包括创造力、远见、多学科思维和人性
