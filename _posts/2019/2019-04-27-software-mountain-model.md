title: 软件开发的山峰模型
---

最近读了一本小册子书《软件开发本质论》，全书一共一百多页，作者是2001年敏捷宣言的起草人，本书就像一位老人，一位前辈，对年轻小辈的字字忠告，没有一行代码，没有复杂的公式，类似这样的小册子，我还看过《简约之美》，非软件开发领域的《谈美》，这些书都不厚，但是可能需要一辈子的时间放在床头。


为什么文章的标题叫山峰模型呢，软件开发如同攀爬一座山峰，有不同的路，不同的风景，有人摔的很惨，有人中途放弃，有人一直在重复前人犯过的错误，有人不断越过低谷抵达理想的高峰，这便是本书最后一段文字所表达意思。

让我们来深入理解这段文字吧，希望我们都能攀过山峰，欣赏壮丽风光：


Imagine that you’re climbing a mountain called Software Development. Maybe you’re a beginner, down near the bottom, walking up steep trails, once in a while clambering over rocks. Maybe you’re pretty advanced, with a whole kit of climbing equipment and knowledge. Maybe you even help others with their own climbing journey. 
Maybe you’re one of those amazing free climbers who can lift yourself from a single hand jam and kick your foot over your head to find the next tiny crevice in what looks like a wall of glass. 


设想你正在攀登一座名为软件开发的山峰，也许你是新手，沿着陡峭山路向上，偶尔需要攀爬岩石，也许你是老手，有整套工具和登山知识，甚至可以帮助别人，也许你是一个徒手攀岩者，能单手在如玻璃一样的岩壁上前进。



Whatever your level, if you’re like me, you spend a lot of time looking at the mountain face right in front of your nose. You spend a lot of time using your mind to figure out your next move upward and which muscles you’ll use to make the move.



无论你是什么水平，如果你像我一样，会花时间研究面前的山峰，思考如何调动自己的肌肉前进。



This book is some words and pictures from someone on the same mountain, who has found a reasonably flat and pleasant place to sit and look around for a while. He looks outward and sees the amazing vista that’s almost always out of sight behind our back as we climb. 
He looks down the mountain and sees its shape and sees the climbers mov- ing upward, some not as well as he did, some much better. He sees the paths on the mountain and can tell which ones are easy, which ones are hard, which ones are safe, and which ones are dangerous.



本书是与你同登山峰的另一个人带给你的只言片语，他找到了平坦舒适的地方，可以坐下来环顾四周。他向山外望去，瞧见了异常漂亮的风景，向下看去，有清晰的山峰轮廓，登山的人有强有弱，山上有很多路，他能辨别容易之路，困难之路，安全之路和危险之路。



Then he looks up, and through the clouds and haze, he realizes that there’s more climbing to do, lots more, as we work our way upward. He sees what look like likely paths and other interesting spots to stop and look around.



向上望去，还有更高的云层和雾霭，路还很长，但是路已经不那么难走了。



He takes some pictures of what he sees and writes a few words about his thoughts and discoveries. He sketches a few paths and tells you a bit about how he recognizes a good path, and what he does when a path turns out not so good. He offers all this to you, to enrich your own journey up the mountain, 
to remind you of the many beautiful views that make the hard climb worthwhile. He reminds you that sometimes the reward is just in the climbing itself, doing it more and more well.



他拍下风景，写下思考和发现，勾画出一些路，告诉你识别好路的经验，以及走错路之后如何采取行动，提醒你不要忘了欣赏那些美丽的风景，正式这些美丽的风景让你觉得无论登山有多么困难，都是值得的，登山的价值在于登山本身，登得越多，水平就越高。
