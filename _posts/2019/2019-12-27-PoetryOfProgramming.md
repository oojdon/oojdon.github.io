Richard Gabriel, Sun的工程师，1981年从斯坦福大学获得计算机科学博士学位，并于1998年回到学校，在沃伦·威尔逊学院获得了诗歌艺术硕士学位

Traditions of computer science and software engineering have tried to turn all aspects of software creation into a pure engineering discipline, when they clearly are not. 

```
计算机科学和软件工程的传统试图将软件创建的各个方面转变为纯粹的工程学科，而事实并非如此
```

my view is that we should train developers the way we train creative people like poets and artists


```
所以我认为我们应该以培训创意的方式来培训开发人员喜欢诗人和艺术家
```

I've probably written about 1000 poems in my life so far, almost all of them in the last two years.

```
过去两年，我大概写了1000首诗
```

and if you look at the source code of extremely talented programmers, there's beauty in it. There's a lot of attention to compression, using the underlying programming language in a way that's easy to penetrate. Yes, writing code and writing poetry are similar.

```
看才华横溢程序员的代码，有美感，用语言淬炼，写代码和写诗极其相似
```


Writing software is an art, and it takes about ten years to really get good at it. 

```
编写软件是一门艺术，要真正精通它大约需要十年
```


Computing has existed for only 50 years. We don't really know what the principles are. True, we know the principles of algorithmic programming reasonably well, but we don't know the principles that govern the software that we're trying to build, and we need to be open-minded about how to do it.

计算仅存在了50年。我们真的不知道这些原则是什么。的确，我们相当了解算法编程的原理，但是我们不知道控制我们试图构建的软件的原理，因此我们需要对如何做到这一点持开放态度。
