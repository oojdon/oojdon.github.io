Can you make a build in one step?
Do you make daily builds?
Do you have a bug database?

Do you have an up-to-date schedule?
Do you have a spec?
Do programmers have quiet working conditions?
Do you use the best tools money can buy?
Do you have testers?
Do new candidates write code during their interview?
Do you do hallway usability testing?

Do you have a bug database?
Do you fix bugs before writing new code?
Do you have an up-to-date schedule?
Do you write a spec before writing code?
Do programmers have quiet working conditions free of interruptions?
Do you use the best development tools money can buy?
Do you have human testers?
Do you do automated testing?
Do new candidates write code as part of the hiring process?
Do you watch people actually try to use your software?
```
