专业软件设计师八个习惯

[原文](https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/habits-of-expert-software-designers/)

```
和用户交谈
设计优雅的抽象
专注于本质
不断模拟
环顾四周
重塑问题空间
视错误为机遇
思考未设计部分
```

识别用户的深层次需求


```
Every design problem has an essence, a core set of considerations that must be understood and “nailed” in the design solution for it to solve the problem successfully.
```

```
consider the problem space more broadly
```


Today, software is no longer limited by technology, but rather by imagination. 
Yet the software that turns the imagined into reality can be complex, and the context in which this transformation must happen can be even more complex.
 This places extraordinary demands on software designers, demands that can be met only if we collectively “step up” to achieve sustained excellence in design


```
如今，软件不再受限于技术，而是受限于想象力。然而，将想象变为现实的软件可能会很复杂，而这种转变必须发生的环境可能会更加复杂。这对软件设计师提出了非凡的要求，只有我们共同“加紧努力”以实现持续的卓越设计才能满足这些要求。
