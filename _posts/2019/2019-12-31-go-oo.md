## Go is a combination of paradigms.

```
It satisfies majority of Object Oriented characteristics (both mainstream and original ones, as stated at the beginning of the article) to solve general software extendibility issues and provide a way for developers to design domains more naturally

It masters Functional/Procedural/Objects characteristics and Messaging to solve problems with concurrency and parallelism in the era of multicore CPU hardware architecture
