[原文](https://fire.ci/blog/essential-skills-every-developer-should-master-besides-coding/)


```
It is teamwork that makes or breaks software projects.
```

* Everyone needs to know what they have to do and when
* People’s work should not overlap or clash
* Common rules need to be followed through by everyone


```
1. Git and Pull Requests
2. The Agile board
3. Testing and Continuous Integration
4. Patience and understanding
```

```
The better your understand the business side of things, the better developer you’ll be.
```

外部的痛苦

The real pain will come from the outside:

* Unclear or misunderstood requirements
* People unhappy with the end result of your work because they didn’t knew what they wanted in the first place and they expected you to figure it out
* Tools that become slow or stop working for some reasons
* Interruptions now and then because people think that sitting at your desk means they can disturb you any time
