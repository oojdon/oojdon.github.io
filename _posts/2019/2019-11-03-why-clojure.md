这是Bob大爷的博客文章，来看看他为什么推荐学习clojure

[原文](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2019/08/22/WhyClojure.html)

Bob用了一打的语言:

I’ve written applications in Fortran, COBOL, PL/1, C, Pascal, C++, Java, Lua, Smalltalk, Logo, and dozens of other languages. 
I’ve used statically typed languages, with lots of type inference


标准语言:Clojure

I believe will eventually become the standard language that all programmers use…
I began to realize that this language was the easiest,

why?

- 表达足够经济 Economy of Expression.
- 没有语法 The language has almost no syntax or grammar.
- Clojure is not slow


更适合构建大系统

Building large systems is Clojure is just simpler and easier than in any other language I’ve used


Lisp回归，拒绝死亡:

Finally, Lisp is functional. And the future is looking very functional to me.
