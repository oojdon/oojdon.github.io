Today to do anything meaningful on a computer you need to know several languages (JS, JQuery, CSS, Html, SQL, XML, JSon, Angular, boostrap etc.) Ok, some of those are not programming languages, but you still have to have a solid grasp of them to get things done.

 Back to the future: One option is to create computers, like my Commodore 64, that break down the barrier between using and programming a computer.  Part of the motivation for the Raspberry Pi, according to Eben Upton, is to re-create the kind of environment that turns users into programmers.

Eben Upton made the Raspberry Pi because he noticed that students applying to study computer science at Cambridge had learned much less than their counterparts 10 years before. The new generation lived in a world of ubiquitous computing, and they had learned very little about computing; the previous generation had battled with the BBC Micro, delving deep into its hardware.

Look at the official Raspberry Pi guide "our first recommendation for adults and older kids interested in getting started with the Raspberry Pi". Depending on the edition, chapter 1 is "Meet the Raspberry Pi". Chapter 2 is "Linux System Administration".
