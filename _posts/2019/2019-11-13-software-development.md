嗯？到底啥叫软件开发？看这个老外的总结，观点犀利

### Software Development, not Programming

**不是编程**

The distinction is quite fuzzy, but I think of programming as getting a computer to do what you want and software development as evolving valuable software with a team. 
Learning programming deserves an entirely different reading list (like this one).
Every programming reading list should include Code Complete, SICP, and this article: Teach Yourself Programming in 10 years. 
(If you are learning programming, you may be interested to peruse my notes about Why & How I Write Java.)

### Software Development, not Computer Science

**不是计算机科学**

(The following observations are not a consensus. 
They are my opinions based on my experience which includes being a computer science teaching assistant for C++, assembly, logic design, algorithms, databases, and artificial intelligence, followed by 7 years of professional software development.)
There is limited overlap between a professional software development (SD) curriculum and a traditional computer science (CS) curriculum. 
A computer science degree often includes learning programming plus courses including automata theory, algorithms, programming language theory, operating systems, networking, cryptography, databases, artificial intelligence, logic design, hardware architecture, etc.
A functional understanding of algorithms, data structures, and complexity (big O) is important for programming. 
A CS database course provides a theoretical foundation for the broader SD challenge of data management in practice. Other than algorithms and databases, I’ve found many CS subjects to be optional (but occasionally helpful) 
for many kinds of software development. 


In some areas of SD a background in UX design or domain knowledge might actually be more helpful than CS.
