Software has characteristics that make it hard to build with traditional management techniques; effective development requires a different, more exploratory and iterative approach.

```
软件具有难以使用传统管理技术进行构建的特征。有效的发展需要一种不同的，更具探索性和迭代性的方法
```

Bad software is one of the few things in the world you cannot solve with money

```
少数不能用钱来解决的问题
```


1. Start as simple as possible;
2. Seek out problems and iterate; and
3. Hire the best engineers you can.

```
尽可能简单的开始
找出问题并迭代
雇佣最好的工程师
```

Modern software is almost never developed from scratch. Even the most innovative applications are built using existing software that has been combined and modified to achieve a new result.

现代软件几乎从来没有从头开始开发。即使是最具创新性的应用程序，也都使用现有软件构建而成，这些软件经过组合和修改以达到新的结果。


### 软件受复杂性限制


```
There is no such thing as platonically good engineering: it depends on your needs and the practical problems you encounter.
```


Software should be treated not as a static product, but as a living manifestation of the development team’s collective understanding.


软件不应被视为静态产品，而应被视为开发团队集体理解的生动体现。
