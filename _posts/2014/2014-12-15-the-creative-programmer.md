Programming requires a lot of creativity, on top of the abstract concepts, tools and techniques that we might learn in a classroom; all that theory represents only a tiny portion of what is necessary to build a great developer.

编程除了需要在课堂上学习的抽象概念，工具和技术之外，还需要大量的创造力。所有这些理论仅代表构建优秀开发人员所需要的一小部分。


Having an artist and an engineer as parents, and getting those influences in my life since I was little, I soon realized that programming combined just the best of both worlds. It's art built on top of logic.

My main and strong motivation with programming, since then, is the ability to create things "out of nothing", bringing ideas to life, with code.

从小我就有一个艺术家和一个工程师作为父母，并在我的生活中获得了这些影响，所以我很快意识到编程结合了两者的优点。它是建立在逻辑之上的艺术。

从那时起，我编程的主要动机就是能够“无所不能”地创建事物，并通过代码将思想变为现实。
