```
There certainly seems to be a very high degree of correlation between programming and music. I'm not sure why that is, or which one leads to the other, but it does seem to be a very popular combination.

Both are highly creative acts, perhaps both are a form of world-building. Maybe we just like to build our own worlds, to create real-world manifestations of our own internal imaginations. Maybe we just like to tinker with own inventions.
