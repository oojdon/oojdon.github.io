title: 比较Theia和VsCode
---

[原文](https://eclipsesource.com/blogs/2019/12/06/the-eclipse-theia-ide-vs-vs-code/)

```
VS Code is an IDE or “source code editor”, initiated and mainly driven by Microsoft
Eclipse Theia is a framework for building web-based IDEs and Tools
Eclipse Theia is available under the Eclipse Public License (EPL)
```

Theia可以一份代码跑在桌面和浏览器，扩展性好，模块性强

VsCode的扩展性依赖插件API，不能作为构建IDE的基础
