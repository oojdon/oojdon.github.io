title: 离开Google
---

这个一个google无名程序员的挣扎，我们可以清楚的看到大公司里的大环境，每个人其实都是这艘大船上的小旗子。

I proudly and lovingly nursed the pipeline back to health. I fixed dozens of bugs and wrote automated tests to make sure they wouldn't reappear. I deleted thousands of lines of code that were either dead or could be replaced by modern libraries. I documented the pipeline as I learned it so that the institutional knowledge was available to my teammates instead of siloed in my head.

The problem, as I discovered at promotion time, was that none of this was quantifiable. I couldn't prove that anything I did had a positive impact on Google.

我自豪又亲切地呵护管道使得它恢复了健康。我修复了数十个bug并编写了自动化测试，以确保它们不会再出现问题。我删除了数千行代码，这些代码要么已经死了，要么完全可以被现代库所取代。我文档化了管道，以便我的队友可以随时了解结构知识。

问题是，正如我在晋升时发现的那样，这些成果没有一个是可以量化的。我无法证明我所做的任何事情对Google产生了积极的影响。


My career was being dictated by a shifting, anonymous committee who thought about me for an hour of their lives. Management decisions that I had no input into were erasing months of my career progress.

我的职业生涯由一个流动的匿名委员会所决定，他们将在一个小时的时间里决定我的前程。一个我抗议无效的管理决策抹杀了我那么多月在事业上取得的进步。
