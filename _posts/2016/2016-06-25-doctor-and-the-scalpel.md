title: 医生和手术刀

[原文](https://hackernoon.com/the-doctor-and-the-scalpel-78656f508c9a)

There's a serious problem in this industry.

这个行业问题重重

There’s always a ramp-up for every new complex ability. Be it a technology or a new concept.

无论是新技术还是新概念，都越来越复杂

When struggling with something, we tend to blame the tools or the syntax.

当遇到麻烦时，我们倾向于责备工具或者语法


Sorry. The problem is not the tool.

对不起，问题其实不在于工具


医生手术出错了，不会责备手术刀

```
The "year 7 and onwards" milestone contain the aspects most big companies look for in an experienced software developer
```
7年是一个里程碑，具备大公司需要的技能


```
Most developers in the industry haven't reached the equivalent for the "7 years of experience" milestone
```

但是大量的开发达不到


Instead of encouraging more developers to join the industry, we need to start educating the existing ones about the importance of writing quality software so that they can act as useful mentors.

我们需要鼓励现有的开发人员学习编写高质量软件的重要性，而不是鼓励更多的开发人员加入该行业，以便他们可以充当有用的指导者。


需要做5件事：

```
框架易逝，学习原理
如果你有博客，开始写为什么
少谈工具，谈概念
如果你做招聘，关注基本原理，不要白板面试
```

```
If you're a big company, stop doing whiteboard code interviews. 
Whiteboard code interviews are not Test-Driven friendly and pose to the developer the needless challenge of finding a solution earlier without running it to check it's correctness first. 
In a real development environment, there's no whiteboard and code must be run. 
Tests need to be created to support that. 
Believe it or not, the best developers can solve a problem with 100% of test coverage for most use cases, but white board interview and edge case testing does not provide a safe environment for doing that.
```


Learning fundamentals allows us to not rely on “magic” and instead think about the problem in a fundamental way instead of outsourcing it.

学习基础知识可以使我们不再依赖“魔术”，而是从根本上考虑问题而不是外包问题。


I hope the industry starts doing the same and building on top of things that are valuable for a professional, not things that will make yourself obsolete in less than one year.

This way we can build trust in society to be seen as the doctor.

A professional who can be accountable and respected for their decisions instead of being forced to kill the patient and blame the scalpel.


我希望业界开始做同样的事情，并以对专业人士有价值的东西为基础，而不是一年之内被淘汰。

这样，我们就可以建立对社会的信任，被视为医生。

可以负责并尊重自己决定的专业人员，而不是被迫杀死患者并责怪手术刀。
