Grammar: a solid grasp of the fundamentals – be that musical notation and theory or knowledge of programming language rules

Logic: you need to be able to create ‘logical arguments’. When writing music or code you need to follow logical rules to get the ‘moving parts’ to work together correctly.

Rhetoric: as well as following grammar and logic, you need to be able to persuade listeners and users of new approaches to standard practice.
