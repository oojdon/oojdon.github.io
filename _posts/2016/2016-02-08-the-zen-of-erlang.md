## Let it crash

## Blow it up

## Fight fire with fire

## Process

## Message Passing 

## Links & Monitor

## Preemptive Scheduling

## Network Aware

![](That’s the Zen of Erlang: building interactions first, making sure the worst that can happen is still okay. Then there will be few faults or failures in your system to make you nervous (and when it happens, you can introspect everything at run time!) You can sit back and relax.)

Erlang 的精髓：首先建立互动，确保可能发生的最坏情况仍然是可行的。那么在你的系统中几乎没有错误或失败会让你紧张（当它发生时，你可以在运行时自省一切！），那样你就可以坐下来放松了。
