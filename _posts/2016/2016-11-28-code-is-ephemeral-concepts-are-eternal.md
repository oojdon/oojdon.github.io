title: 代码易逝，概念永恒

[原文](https://exceptionnotfound.net/code-is-ephemeral-concepts-are-eternal/)


```
Learn about SOLID. Learn KISS, DRY, and YAGNI. Learn how important naming is. Learn about proper spacing, functional vs object-oriented, composition vs. inheritance, polymorphism, etc. Learn soft skills like communication and estimation. Learn all the ideas that result in good code, rather than the details (syntax, limitations, environment, etc.) of the code itself. Mastering the ideas leads to your mind being able to warn you when you are writing bad code (as you will inevitably do).
```

去掌握SOLID,KISS,DRY,YANGI，组合与继承，函数式，OO


```
code is ephemeral, concepts are eternal. Code is static; it will die, fall apart, degrade. It may take a long time, years or decades, but it will happen. But the concepts which programming lives off of do not die; they live on.
```
代码是静态，会死亡，会崩溃，会退化，但是编程赖以生存的概念却继续存在
