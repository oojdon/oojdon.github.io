三十年软件交付总结，好项目和差项目的区别就是简单性

```
Simple is not simplistic, it isn’t quick and dirty, it isn’t lazy, it usually takes longer and it’s not doable without imagination and creativity.
Simple is also not just about writing code, it involves everything associated with building software, from people to processes, from how you make decisions to how you organize their implementations. 
Simple is an attitude, it has to pervade everything you do and how you think and you can never stop looking for it, because as soon as you allow complexity in it will take over everything and you won’t be able to remove it again.
```


```
简单不是简单化，它不是快速而肮脏的，它不是懒惰的，它通常需要更长的时间，并且没有想象力和创造力就无法实现。
简单不仅涉及编写代码，还涉及与构建软件相关的所有内容，从人员到流程，从决策方式到组织实施的方式。
简单是一种态度，它必须遍历您所做的一切以及您的想法，并且永远都不会停止寻找它，因为一旦您允许其中的复杂性，它就会接管一切，并且您将无法再次删除它。
```

```
the more complexity you add to any system the less you understand what it is doing, the less you see what the customer will see, 
the harder it is to change, the further behind you will get
```
复杂性越大，可理解性越少
